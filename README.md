# SpotifyMusicSuggestion
Messing around with Spotify's web api to suggest music to people based on the decade and genre of music they already listen to. Loosely inspired by receiptify (https://github.com/michellexliu/receiptify) because I use it a lot and wanted to try to make something along similar lines. Ideally I'll get this to a point where I can actually deploy this.
